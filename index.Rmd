## Bio

Hi, I’m Benjamín! I’m a postdoctoral fellow in the <a href="http://www.vaquerizaslab.org/people/#Benjamin
">Regulatory Genomics</a> group at the <a href="https://www.mpi-muenster.mpg.de/">Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine</a> in Münster, Germany. My research is focused on understanding the role that 3D organisation of chromatin plays in regulating gene expression. I use R and Python to analyse genomic datasets to make comparative analyses of 3D genome organisation. My primary model organism is the zebrafish, but I frequently collaborate with researchers working on other organisms, including mouse and human.
