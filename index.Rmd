## Bio

Hi, I’m Ben! I’m a computational biologist based in Melbourne, Australia.  My research is focused on understanding the role that 3D organisation of chromatin plays in regulating gene expression. I use R and Python to analyse genomic datasets to make comparative analyses of 3D genome organisation. My primary model organism is the zebrafish, but I frequently collaborate with researchers working on other organisms, including mouse and human.
